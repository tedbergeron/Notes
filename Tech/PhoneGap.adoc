	A Message from PhoneGap:

Come prepared for your workshops tomorrow by installing some tools in advance.

Some Recommendations for the PhoneGap Essentials Workshop:
•	Node.js
•	The latest PhoneGap CLI https://www.npmjs.org/package/phonegap
•	The latest Cordova CLI https://www.npmjs.org/package/cordova
•	PhoneGap Developer App installed on your device http://app.phonegap.com/
•	The Ionic CLI https://www.npmjs.org/package/ionic

It's also recommended to have an account on PhoneGap Build. https://build.phonegap.com/

If you would like to be able to run all features on a specific device then you will need to have the SDK installed for your platform. Here are some guides and links:
•	Android SDK http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
•	iOS (on a Mac) http://docs.phonegap.com/en/edge/guide_platforms_ios_index.md.html#iOS%20Platform%20Guide
