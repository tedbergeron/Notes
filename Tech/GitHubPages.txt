I ran into an issue trying to host my reveal.js slide deck on gh-pages

If you haven't initialized your submodule, you will need to initialize it with the following steps:

In the submodule's directory, run 

 git submodule init

then 

 git submodule update.

Commit and push your changes to trigger another build on the server.


TIP: We strongly recommend running Jekyll locally so you can easily debug and fix build errors before pushing to GitHub.
