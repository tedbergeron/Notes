== AsciiDoc Notes

=== AsciiDoc

* AsciiDoc 8.6.9
** requires Python.
** I've used this on Linux

=== Asciidoctor things I've tried

* Asciidoctor
** Generates .html, .ePUB, slide decks
*** link:testasciidoc_icons_font.html[HTML generated with icons from font awesome]
*** link:testasciidoc-a_font.html[HTML generated with icons as images]
*** link:testasciidoc-default.html[HTML generated with no icons]

* Asciidoctor-decks
** Create slide shows with deck.js or reveal.js
** NOTE: deck.js is more developed than reveal at this time.
* Asciidoctor-diagram
** creates images from text diagrams
** I have not figured this one out.
* Asciidoctor-epub3
** Creates an epub file
** asciidoctor -r asciidoctor-epub3 -b epub3 sample-book.adoc
* Asciidoctor-stylesheet-factor
** generates Asciidoctor .css files

=== AsciiDoc Editor | Viewer

* ATOM editor
** AsciiDoc-Preview. Best *editor | viewer* I've found.
* AsciiDocBox
** This is an HTML *editor | viewer* similar to what we are building.
* Asciidoctor-chrome-extention
** *Viewer only* works fantastic, includes themes
* Sublime Text
** Viewer
** Editor has an AsciiDoc syntax highlighter, but it only works with some of the themes.
* Brackets
** The Brackets.io editor has a new AsciiDocs preview plugin (5/16/2014)
** now supports syntax highlighting and admonition icons and themes.
** Splits screen horizontally :(
