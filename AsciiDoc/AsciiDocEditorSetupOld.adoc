= Editor Setup for Writing AsciiDoc
:icons: font
 

This explains how to use a text editor and web browser to write and preview AsciiDoc text documents.

 

 

== Add syntax highlighter to Notepad++

 
Download the *userDefineLang.xml* from here:

https://github.com/edusantana/asciidoc-highlight

 

Place in your directory

 C:\Users\tbergeron\AppData\Roaming\Notepad++

 

To use, open a text doc with AsciiDoc extension. .adoc, .asc, .asciidoc

 

e.g. *example.adoc*. _I know .adoc works. I have not tested the other file extensions_

 

=== Troubleshooting Notepad++

 

.If you already have a userDefineLang.xml file

IMPORTANT: If you have multiple user defined languages, you can renamed the file: userDefineLang_AsciiDoc.xml

_

 

.In Notepad++

* Language > Define you own language

* ... more help needed here... All I have is Language > User Defined??

** I think "User Defined" means it will look at the file named userDefineLang.xml

 

 

TIP: There is an AsciiDoc syntax highlighter for Sublime Text also.

 

 

== Add Chrome browser extension

 

* Get more extensions

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions?hl=en-US

* Search for asciidoc

* Install *Asciidoctor.js Live Preview*

 

=== Adjust settings

 

* In Chrome, go to: Settings > Extensions > Asciidoctor.js Live Preview

* Check to allow access to file URLs.

* Browse to your text file

 

file:///C:/Users/tbergeron/Desktop/AsciiDocSetup.adoc

* File must have .adoc extension. _I have not tested other extensions_

 

 

TIP: Try out the various themes such as *riak* or *readthedocs* theme in the Asciidoctor.js Live Preview > Options
