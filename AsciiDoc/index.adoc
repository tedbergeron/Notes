=== Asciidoctor Rendering HTML

 > asciidoctor testasciidoc.adoc

You can also point to a stylesheet

 > asciidoctor -a linkcss testasciidoc.adoc

Samples of HTML output

* link:testasciidoc_icons_font.html[] with icons font
* link:testasciidoc-a_font.html[] with image icons
* link:testasciidoc-default.html[] no icons

=== Asciidoctor Rendering slide deck

 > asciidoctor -T templates/slim deck.txt

=== Asciidoctor Rendering to PDF

 > asciidoctor-pdf deck.txt

* e.g. link:AsciiDocBrownBag/deck.pdf[Asciidoctor PDF] rendering the deck.txt file

==== PDF Themes

===== Change Page Size

 :pdf-page-size: A5

Then when you render it
> asciidoctor-pdf MyTestDocument.adoc

it produces a .pdf with page size 5.83 x 8.27 in

In inches

 :pdf-page-size: 6in x 9in

===== Change Fonts

You can change the font by creating a style in a .yml file. You can start with this https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/blob/master/data/themes/base-theme.yml

TIP: Notice the page_size: A4. You could set it here instead of inside your .adoc file

Save base-theme.yml in a directory MyThemes. After you've made your font changes, render it like this

 > asciidoctor-pdf -a pdf-stylesdir=MyThemes -a pdf-style=base MyTestDocument.adoc

The -a pdf-style=base will look for a "base-theme-yml" file in your "MyThemes" directory

For more information about PDF Themes: https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/blob/master/docs/theming-guide.adoc


=== Reveal.js print to PDF

* Requires Chrome
* Add print-pdf in the query string
** link:AsciiDocBrownBag/deck.html?print-pdf[]
* Change the Destination setting to Save as PDF.
* Change the Layout to Landscape.
* Change the Margins to None.
* Click Save.
* link:AsciiDocBrownBag/RevealPrintToPDF.pdf[]

=== Asciidoctor Rendering to EPUB

 $ asciidoctor-epub3 sample-book.adoc

This will produce sample-book.epub

We also recommend specifying an output directory using the -D option flag.

 $ asciidoctor-epub3 -D output data/samples/sample-book.adoc

When the script completes, you'll see the file sample-book.epub appear in the _output_ directory. Open that file with an EPUB3 reader to view the result.


== Other Info

=== Command Line to create file with filenames

.Create _index.txt from command prompt
 dir /B /ON > _index.txt


=== Gist.Asciidoctor.org

You could imitate link:http://txti.es/about[txti], light weight web pages from Markdown, by using http://gist.asciidoctor.org/

* Start with an AsciiDoc file posted online: https://github.com/tedbergeron/AsciidoctorSemanticColors/blob/gh-pages/index.adoc
* Paste URL into http://gist.asciidoctor.org/
* Then use the menu:Share[Short URL > remove header and footer]

Output http://goo.gl/x3J2Xp (notice none of the colors assigned in the docinfo.html are rendered here)
