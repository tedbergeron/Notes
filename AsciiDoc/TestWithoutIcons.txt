= Test document without icons font
:icons: 
:status: images/icons/note.png

.Response
[icon="{status}"]
[NOTE]
====
Icons Font option takes control over the admonition icons and converts it to the fixed element:
 <i class="fa icon-note"...

As far as I can see to get your own icon into the admonition you have to set the icons attribute to anything but font and set all icons yourself
